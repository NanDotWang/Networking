/// A generic subclass of AsyncOperation which manages a one-to-many 
/// relationship between itself and a dynamic number of requests. The result of 
/// the task execution is distributed among all active requests.
///
/// The generic `<Result>` parameter allows for domain-specific flexibility. For 
/// example, an image cache might only need something as simple as a `UIImage?`,
/// whereas a more complex task might use a custom enum with success and error
/// cases.
///
/// Requests can be cancelled individually. Each request has its own preferred
/// queue priority, but the priority of the task operation resolves to the
/// highest priority among the active requests. Adding or cancelling requests
/// will cause the resolved priority to be recomputed. If the last remaining
/// request is cancelled, the operation itself will be cancelled.
/// 
/// AsyncTaskOperation can be used by itself, or in combination with other
/// (NS)Operations in your own (NS)OperationQueue. 
/// 
/// If you need to also ensure that a given task is only performed once per some
/// arbitrary task identifier (again, an image cache is a good example) consider
/// using AsyncTaskQueue.

    /// task operation finishes and produces a result. The same result will be
    /// distributed to the result handlers of all active requests. This closure
    /// will be invoked on the main queue.
    /// 
    /// ### Avoiding Race Conditions
    /// 
    /// Adding requests to a task operation is a highly race-dependent feature.
    /// Therefore a request cannot be guaranteed to be added. If the operation
    /// is cancelled (or about to be cancelled) or finished (or about to be
    /// finished), it cannot accept additional requests.
    /// 
    /// Rather than silently failing to add a request, `addRequest()` will
    /// communicate to the caller whether or not the request was successfully
    /// added via the `tokenHandler` closure argument. This closure receives an
    /// optional RequestToken argument. If this argument is `nil`, the request
    /// failed to be added. If this argument is not nil, the caller can assume
    /// that the `resultHandler` will be called at some point in the future
    /// (unless, of course, the operation is later cancelled, in which case the
    /// result handlers are not called by design).
    ///
    /// It is critical to notice that the token handler is non-escaping. This is
    /// because otherwise `addRequest()` could not guarantee that the calling
    /// thread has a chance to capture the token value **before the result 
    /// handler could possibly be called**. If, for example, the request token 
    /// was a returned value, and if the calling thread was part of a concurrent
    /// queue, it would be possible for the result handler to be called (on the
    /// main queue) at the same time as or before the calling thread can store 
    /// the token value. It is conceivable that an implementation might need to
    /// use the request token as part of updating some other internal state in a
    /// manner that is guaranteed to occur before the result handler fires (for 
    /// example, showing/hiding an indeterminate activity indicator). For these
    /// reasons, the token is returned via a non-escaping closure.
    /// 
    /// - Warning: The token handler is invoked from inside a critical section
    /// of code managed by a non-recursive lock. Calling methods or setting
    /// properties on an AsyncTaskOperation from inside a token handler could
    /// lead to deadlock and is not supported.
