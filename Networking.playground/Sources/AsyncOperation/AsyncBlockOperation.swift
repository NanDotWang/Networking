/// A concrete subclass of AsyncOperation for executing an arbitrary block of
/// asynchronous code. 
/// 
/// AsyncBlockOperation is similar to (NS)BlockOperation, except for two important differences:
///
/// - AsyncBlockOperation only supports a single execution block.
///
/// - AsyncBlockOperation will remain in its executing state until the
/// execution block invokes its finish handler argument. This makes it easier to
/// establish dependencies with other (NS)Operations. It is up to the caller to
/// ensure that the finish handler is invoked when the block is done.
