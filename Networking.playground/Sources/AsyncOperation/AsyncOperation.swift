/// An abstract subclass of (NS)Operation which allows for the asynchronous 
/// execution of arbitrary code. Unlike most (NS)Operations, an AsyncOperation
/// will remain in its executing state until the asynchronous execution signals
/// that it has finished. This makes it possible to compose complex behaviours
/// out of a mixture of asynchronous and synchronous operations, and with all
/// the benefits of using an (NS)OperationQueue (dependency chaining, 
/// cancellation, priorities, etc).
/// 
/// AsyncOperation is not meant to be used directly, but only via concrete 
/// subclasses. Subclasses must override `execute(finish:)` (see below).
