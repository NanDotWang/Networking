/// AsyncTaskQueue manages an operation queue of AsyncTaskOperations, ensuring
/// that long-running work is only performed once per a unique user-provided
/// task identifier.
/// 
/// You might choose an AsyncTaskQueue when there is an expensive unit of work
/// which is repeatedly requested from multiple callers. Rather than performing
/// that work multiple times for each caller, AsyncTaskQueue coalesces those
/// requests into a single AsyncTaskOperation, distributing the shared result 
/// among all callers.
/// 
/// A unit of work is identified by a user-provided task identifer (the `TaskID`
/// generic type). Two tasks using the same task identifer are assumed to 
/// produce an identical result (given the same environmental conditions). Task
/// blocks submitted to AsyncTaskQueue should be aware therefore that they are
/// not guaranteed to each be executed. If an existing task operation exists for
/// a given task id, subsequent task blocks for that same id will be quietly
/// ignored.
/// 
/// The generic `<Result>` parameter allows for domain-specific flexibility. For
/// example, an image cache might only need something as simple as a `UIImage?`,
/// whereas a more complex task might use a custom enum with success and error
/// cases.
///
/// AsyncTaskQueue does not cache results. Non-concurrent requests for the same 
/// task identifier may result in duplicate task operations if the earlier task 
/// operation finishes before the next task request arrives. It is the caller's
/// responsiblity to cache results if needed and to ensure that subsequent tasks 
/// aren't needlessly requested.
///
/// Requests can be cancelled individually. Each request has its own preferred
/// queue priority, but the priority of the underlying task operation resolves 
/// to the highest priority among the active requests. Adding or cancelling 
/// requests will cause the resolved priority to be recomputed. If the last 
/// remaining request is cancelled, the whole task operation will be cancelled.

    /// - note: It is also possible that there is an existing task operation 
    /// but the request could not be added to it because the operation was 
    /// cancelled (or cancelling) or finished (or finishing). This is not likely
    /// to occur often. If it occurs, a new task operation will be created and 
    /// the request will be added to it.
    /// 
    /// - parameter task: The task block. This block will be quietly ignored if
    /// an existing task operation already exists for `taskId`.
    /// 
    /// - parameter taskId: The unique, user-provided identifier for the task.
    /// Two task blocks with equal task identifiers, assuming the same 
    /// environmental conditions, should produce identical results. For example,
    /// an image cache using a task queue might use image URLs for task ids.
    /// 
    /// - parameter cancellation: The block which will be invoked if the task
    /// later becomes cancelled. This should stop any child procedures spawned
    /// by the task block. This block will be quietly ignored if an existing
    /// task operation already exists for `taskId`.

    /// - parameter preferredPriority: The priority at which the task operation
    /// is preferred to run. The actual priority of a task operation resolves to
    /// the highest requested priority among its active requests. Callers are
    /// thus guaranteed that the task will be performed at or above their
    /// requested priority level.
    /// 
    /// - parameter tokenHandler: A non-escaping closure which passes the 
    /// request token back to the caller. See the documentation for 
    /// `AsyncTaskOperation` for details on why this is a non-escaping closure
    /// rather than a return value.
    /// 
    /// - parameter resultHandler: A handler via which the caller will recieve
    /// the result of the task. A task is only performed once, but the result
    /// will be distributed among all requests by invoking each one's result
    /// handler. This block will not be called if the task is cancelled before
